    <p>It was a normal day at high school, and we all gathered for lunch  <br>
      A girl sat beside her friends, just about to munch <br>
All of sudden there was shouting, things started to get loud <br>Students were gathering around the girl, forming a crowd<br>
She was getting beat up, in front of the entire school<br>
All because one day, people decided she was no longer cool <br>
      <br><br>
I wasn’t that cool either, as far as I could see<br>
This made me wonder, if the next ambush was going to be me <br>But I wasn’t going to find out, if I was accepted or denied<br>
I went around school, looking for a place to hide<br>
That’s when I found, art class was open every recess<br>
It became my refuge, my outlet, it was my creative nest<br>
I know my drawing skills weren’t as awesome as my peers<br> yet I continued anyways, for the next few years<br><br>
I wanted to increase my skills and knowledge <br>So after high school, I went straight to college <br>The artists there were skilled and competitive<br>
I got discouraged, and felt very negative<br>
and as time passed, I could not help but notice<br>
my classmates were growing, and I was still a novice<br><br>
I decided I should do something more purposeful with my life<br> I quit art for good, became a mother, and a housewife<br>
I loved my new journey, no need to look back<br>
I had everything I needed, there is nothing I lack<br> For years I completely stopped making art<br>
No time or interest, I let it depart<br><br>
One day I noticed, something about my kid’s school<br>
There were no sports, field trips, music, - this was boring and cruel<br> Parents wanted something educational and fun<br>
But the principal apologized, because funding there was none<br><br>
So I gathered cheap supplies, and filled up my cart<br>
And decided afterschool, these students were going to do art<br> I would teach them myself, as much as I knew<br>
And little by little my art class grew<br>
I saw in these students, something I once saw in me<br>
A creative mind ready and wanting to be free<br><br>
My intentions were originally to just teach the student<br> But during class time I had a moment<br>
I remembered how much I used loved to create<br> When it did not even matter, if the result was great<br>
But somehow I quit doing what I loved to do<br>
I had too much doubt, and encouragement - few<br> <br>I wanted to give this art thing another shot<br>
But teaching I’ll do, selling artwork I will not<br>
now I decided I’m not going to judge or compare myself<br> Success cannot be measured by likes or wealth<br>
I want to inspire young people I come across<br>
Because I know it is easy for kids to become loss<br>
I know there is someone out there like me<br> That needs a special place for them to be<br> A place they can isolate, focus, and create <br>To have a joyful therapeutic state<br><br>

Although I am a teacher, I am still an artist<br>
But not like the ones, common among us<br>
My material is no longer just paint and canvas<br>
It is the students I train, in me they put their trust<br>
I shape my students minds, like a sculpture does clay <br>I carve out the negativity,and let the good things stay<br> I like to give young people what I didn’t have<br>
To help them succeed makes me glad
